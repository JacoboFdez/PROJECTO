## Introduction
Steam is a digital video game distribution platform developed by Valve Corporation. It was released in September 2003 as a way for Valve to provide automatic updates to its games, but was eventually expanded to include third-party games. Steam offers hack protection,4​5​ matchmaking servers, video streaming, and social networking services. It also provides the user with automatic installation and updating of games and community features such as groups and friend lists, cloud saves, in-game voice and chat functionality.

It is used by both small independent developers and large software corporations for the distribution of video games and related multimedia material.

In order to enjoy all these services, it is necessary to be registered with the service by creating a free account, to which the video games purchased by the player are linked. These games can be both games offered for purchase on the platform itself and certain games purchased in physical stores.
